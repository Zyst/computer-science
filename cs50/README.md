Harvard Legendary CS50 class.

I don't want to ruin the fun of the PSets if someone finds this through Google, so I'm doing two versions of this stuff. One in Golang (here), and one in C/PHP/Whatever they have us use that week.

That way I get to both practice Golang, which I'm learning (https://github.com/Zyst/learning-golang) and have fun with CS50.
